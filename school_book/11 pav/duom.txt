Maèernis was born in the village of Ðarnelë (now in Plungë district municipality), to the parents Vladas Maèernis and Elþbieta Maèernienë and was the 2nd eldest among his 12 siblings (of whom 6 died in early childhood). He grew up in his home village, where he wrote most of his poems. His grandmother, who died in 1934, appears in most of his poems as a warm and pleasant memory, as the poet's relation with his grandmother was much closer than the one with his mother.
In 1935 he finished Seda progymnasium and continued his education in Telðiai gymnasium. It was in the gymnasium that Vytautas started writing poems. His biographers describe his personality as withdrawn and thoughtful during those years.
Vytautas Maèernis studied English language and literature in Kaunas and philosophy at the University of Vilnius. He would attend lectures related to Lithuanistics, as well as those delivered by Vincas Krëvë, Vincas Mykolaitis Putinas, take part in the seminars by Balys Sruoga. In 1943 when the university was shut down during the Nazi occupation, he went back to his home village, where he self-studied astronomy and physics, translated works of Oscar Milosz, studied French, having had plans to study in the University of Sorbone. Maèernis was keen on languages and could speak German, English, French, Italian, Russian, Latin and Greek, apart from his native Samogitian and Standard Lithuanian ones.
The poet died on October 7, 1944 in Þemaièiø Kalvarija, hit by a stray bullet.
